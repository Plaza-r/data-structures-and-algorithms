## WhiteBoard
![challenge33whiteboard](python/docs/hashtable_left_join/challenge33.png)
## Challenge
Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
Write a function called left join
Arguments: two hash maps
The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
